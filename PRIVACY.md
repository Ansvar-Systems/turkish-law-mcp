# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under Turkish bar association rules and the KVKK.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Risks:**
- Queries through Claude API flow via Anthropic cloud infrastructure
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Turkish bar rules (Türkiye Barolar Birliği / local bar associations) require strict confidentiality under the Avukatlık Kanunu

**Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **Local npm Package**: Install `@ansvar/turkish-law-mcp` locally — database queries stay on your machine
3. **Remote Endpoint**: Vercel Streamable HTTP endpoint — queries transit Vercel infrastructure
4. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with AI clients:

```
User Query -> MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Cursor/API) -> Anthropic Cloud -> MCP Server -> Database
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Local npm Package (Most Private)

```bash
npx @ansvar/turkish-law-mcp
```

- Database is local SQLite file on your machine
- No data transmitted to external servers (except to AI client for LLM processing)
- Full control over data at rest

#### 2. Remote Endpoint (Vercel)

```
Endpoint: https://turkish-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp
```

- Queries transit Vercel infrastructure
- Tool responses return through the same path
- Subject to Vercel's privacy policy

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through an AI client:

- **Query Text**: Your search queries and tool parameters
- **Tool Responses**: Statute text, provision content, search results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, request identifiers

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (depends on AI client configuration)

## Professional Obligations (Turkey)

### Turkish Bar Association Rules

Turkish lawyers (avukatlar) are bound by strict confidentiality rules under the Avukatlık Kanunu (Law No. 1136), the Türkiye Barolar Birliği Meslek Kuralları, and the Turkish Penal Code (TCK).

#### Avukatlık Sırrı (Professional Secrecy)

- All client communications are privileged under avukatlık sırrı
- Client identity may be confidential in sensitive matters
- Case strategy and legal analysis are protected
- Information that could identify clients or matters must be safeguarded
- Breach of professional secrecy may result in disciplinary sanctions and criminal liability under TCK Article 239

### KVKK Compliance

Under **Kişisel Verilerin Korunması Kanunu (KVKK, Law No. 6698)**, when using services that process client data:

- You are the **Data Controller** (Veri Sorumlusu)
- AI service providers (Anthropic, Vercel) may be **Data Processors** (Veri İşleyen)
- A **Data Processing Agreement** may be required
- The **KVKK Authority** (Kişisel Verileri Koruma Kurumu) is the supervisory authority
- Cross-border data transfers require adequate safeguards under KVKK Article 9
- Ensure adequate technical and organizational measures are in place

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### LOW RISK: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through any deployment:**

```
Example: "What does the Turkish Commercial Code say about board liability?"
```

- No client identity involved
- No case-specific facts
- Publicly available legal information

### MEDIUM RISK: Anonymized Queries

**Use with caution:**

```
Example: "What are the penalties for bribery under the Turkish Penal Code?"
```

- Query pattern may reveal you are working on a bribery matter
- Anthropic/Vercel logs may link queries to your API key

### HIGH RISK: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through cloud AI services:**

- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use the local npm package with a self-hosted LLM
- Or use commercial legal databases (Kazancı, Lexpera, Sinerji) with proper data processing agreements

## Recommendations

### For Solo Practitioners / Small Firms

1. Use local npm package for maximum privacy
2. General research: Cloud AI is acceptable for non-client queries
3. Client matters: Use commercial legal databases (Kazancı, Lexpera, Sinerji)

### For Large Firms / Corporate Legal

1. Negotiate data processing agreements with AI service providers
2. Consider on-premise deployment with self-hosted LLM
3. Train staff on safe vs. unsafe query patterns
4. Ensure compliance with KVKK cross-border transfer requirements

### For Government / Public Sector

1. Use self-hosted deployment, no external APIs
2. Follow Turkish government information security requirements
3. Air-gapped option available for classified matters
